"It doesn't look like much, does it?", Ric Ormur looked at a sheet of paper lying on the table in front of her. On it, faintly lit by the light coming from the neon signs advertizing the bar's many beverages, was a scribbled star chart.
"It's a lead." Recall said, it's voice buzzy deep within it's chest. It sounded contemplative.

Ric often felt she could feel the emotions in Recall's voice. Recall would disagree of course. It said it did not experience emotions, at least not in the ways humans did. Ric had learned to let the topic of emotions pass. If it made Recall
happy to not feel emotions, then who was she to judge.

Val Worthy sat opposite them in their booth. His massive arms were held in a studiously relaxed posture. "Look, gals," His voice made Ric feel like she was standing with her back to a giant tree. "If you're not interested..."

Recall cut hum off. "As a point of order, I am not a gal. And we are interested." It shot a look at Ric.
Ric shrugged. "Thirty-four brass. I'm not paying any more than that just to race everyother hunter you can find to a coordinate this far out." She tapped the paper.
Val frowned and crossed his arms. "I'm not selling this to anyone else. I'm offering you an exclusive lead here. I think this one will be interesting to you, in particular."

"Why is that?" Ric arched her eyebrow. It was a practiced expression, and she was pleased with the effect.

Val smiled. "I've heard that you might be looking for the makers, and from the reports, this looks like a maker world."

Recall set its hand on the paper. "Pay him, Ric."
